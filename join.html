	<p> As much as I'm willing to do the work, let's face it, I'm not as spry as I once was. So, if you're out there- someone with a passion for strange mysteries and a taste for adventure (or at least a willingness to get your hands dirty), I could really use your help.</p>
	<p>I may be a lone man on a mission, but with your support, we can get to the bottom of this rodent riddle once and for all.</p>

	<h2>Terms and Conditions of the Chicago Underground Rat Investigation Society
Last updated: November 25, 2024
1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or participating in the Chicago Underground Rat Investigation Society (hereinafter referred to as “The Society”), you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms and Conditions. These terms govern your use of The Society’s activities, services, and any rat-related discoveries made in the course of such participation. If you do not agree with these terms, please refrain from joining the Society and/or engaging in any rat-related investigations.
2. Membership Eligibility
Membership in The Society is open to all individuals who have an interest in rats, urban mysteries, or the potential existence of a giant rat beneath the city of Chicago. While no prior rat experience is necessary, a willingness to handle potentially questionable rodent encounters is strongly encouraged. By joining, you affirm that you are mentally prepared for the possible discovery of large, unusual rats (or at least very enthusiastic rodents).
3. Code of Conduct
As a member, you agree to:
Refrain from engaging in any rat-related activities that could cause harm to rats, large or small, or to the city's delicate underground ecosystems.
Respect the secrecy of rat holes, tunnels, and other rat infrastructure discovered during investigations. The Society will not tolerate any destruction of rat homes, whether accidental or intentional.
Wear appropriate footwear when investigating rat tunnels, as there is a chance of encountering rats, rat nests, or debris from previous rat parties.
Acknowledge that while rats may or may not be involved, your safety is the primary concern, and you agree to follow all safety instructions provided by The Society’s founder, Gerald.
4. Rat Liability
While The Society endeavors to avoid direct contact with rats (giant or otherwise), members must be aware that the investigation process might involve unforeseen rat-related risks, including, but not limited to:
Rat sightings or rat-related noises (such as scurrying or squeaking).
Possible rat encounters in confined spaces, such as tunnels, sewers, and alleyways.
Rat droppings, urine, or fur in the investigation areas.
Occasional rat-related smells or the presence of other pests.
By becoming a member, you acknowledge and accept full responsibility for any rat-related injuries, surprises, or mishaps that may arise during investigations. The Society and Gerald are not liable for any such occurrences, regardless of size, number, or the perceived "giantness" of said rats.
5. Exploration Limits
While the goal of The Society is to investigate and uncover the potential presence of a giant rat, members understand that The Society does not guarantee that any rat, large or otherwise, will be found. In the event that a giant rat is discovered, members are asked to report the sighting immediately but are not permitted to engage with or attempt to capture the rat unless expressly instructed by Gerald.
6. Use of Rat-Related Equipment
Members may be required to use certain tools and equipment during their investigation, including but not limited to:
Flashlights (to spot rats or rat holes).
Rat traps (for monitoring purposes only).
Cameras (to document rat sightings or underground tunnels).
Protective gloves and gear (for handling any rat-related debris or hazardous materials).
Members are required to return all equipment in good condition and may be held financially responsible for any damage caused by improper use or interaction with rats.
7. Confidentiality and Reporting
All findings from rat investigations, whether they involve giant rats or mere rat sightings, must be reported to Gerald, the sole member of The Society. No other parties should be informed of any rat-related discoveries without prior consent. Members are encouraged to keep all rat-related data confidential to preserve the integrity of the investigation and avoid causing unnecessary panic among non-members of The Society.
8. Termination of Membership
Membership in The Society may be revoked at any time by Gerald if a member:
Is caught engaging in rat-related activities outside the guidelines set forth by The Society (such as attempting to raise rats, or worse, befriending them).
Fails to abide by the Code of Conduct, including disturbing rats or other rodent life unnecessarily.
Demonstrates a lack of respect for the rat community, regardless of their size.
Should a member be terminated, they will not be entitled to a refund of any investigation fees or access to previously gathered rat data.
9. Rat Encounters in Media
Any media (photos, videos, written reports) that involve rats found during investigations remain the property of The Society. The inclusion of rats in such media does not imply that the rats are “giant” or extraordinary in any way, unless clearly stated. Any depictions of rats in media shared by The Society are strictly for investigation purposes and should not be used for commercial gain without express written permission from Gerald.
10. Disclaimer of Liability
The Society makes no guarantees about the discovery of any rats, whether they are large, small, or somewhere in between. While every effort is made to maintain safety during investigations, The Society is not responsible for:
Any injuries caused by rats, rat encounters, or falls during investigations.
Loss of personal property due to rodent activity.
Psychological trauma stemming from extreme rat sightings, whether large or just unpleasant.
By participating in any investigation, you agree to release The Society, Gerald, and any associated entities from all claims arising from rat-related activities.
11. Modifications to Terms
The Society reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time, particularly as rat-related discoveries evolve or new rat theories emerge. Any changes to these terms will be communicated to all members, who will be asked to review and re-accept the new terms if they wish to continue their participation in the investigation.
12. Final Provisions
By becoming a member of The Society, you acknowledge and agree that your involvement in the search for a giant rat is purely for informational and investigatory purposes. This is not a formal rat-hunting organization, nor is it an attempt to profit from rat sightings or discoveries. The Society exists for one reason only: to discover the truth about the rat rumors of Chicago. That is all. If you understand and accept that, then welcome aboard!
Rat sightings are not guaranteed. Giant rats may or may not exist. Investigations may or may not be hazardous. Proceed at your own risk.
Contact
For inquiries regarding these Terms and Conditions, please contact Gerald at the nearest pest control office, preferably one without a rat infestation.
Thank you for joining the Chicago Underground Rat Investigation Society!</h2>
