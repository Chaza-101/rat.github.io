	<p>"The rat has an average life span of six to twelve months. Beginning at the age of two to three months, a female rat can produce four to seven litters per year with each litter containing eight to twelve pups ... They prefer fresh food, but will eat many things such as pet food, dog feces, garbage and plants. If food is scarce, the strongest rats may even eat the weakest and young." <p>
	<p>Whatever is down there could be multiplying faster than this ... and is definitely not eating fresh. Rats have a tendency to keep on living no matter what, very similar to roaches.</p>

	<p>"Rat king sightings date as far back as the 1500s ... Those who hold that the phenomenon is real, say that it occurs when a group of rats, while confined to a small space such as a burrow or other cramped living quarters, simply becomes matted together ... The phenomenon is made all the more believable because rats, like humans, produce sebum, or natural oil, in order to protect and hydrate the surface of their skin. It is thus possible that the oily tails of a dozen or so rats could form a sticky substance and bind the rats together."</p>
	<p>A lead on what could be down there? It could make sense, a giant rat king that's been brewing down there since who knows when.</p>
