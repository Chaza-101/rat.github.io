	<h1>A Call For Help.</h1>
	</header>

		<p>Hello, my name is Gerald T. Reyes. I've been working in pest control, specifically rat catching, for the last 20 years. Over the course of my career, I've encountered some truly strange and unsettling cases. Rats with too many tails, rats with multiple heads, mutations that just don't seem possible... these are the kinds of things you don't expect to see, but after a couple of decades, they start to feel more and more frequent. It's part of the job, I guess.</p>
		<p>Lately, however, there's been a noticeable shift. Calls have been down, and I can't help but feel that something's off. Now, don't get me wrong- pest control is a booming business in Chicago. The rat population here never seems to dwindle, and people are constantly coming and going, so a drop in calls is somewhat expected. But even my regular customers- the ones who've stayed in the same apartment for years- have stopped reaching out. This isn't typical.</p>
		<p>One particular customer, Mr. James P. Moss, who's been a steady source of income for me thanks to his landlord habits, hasn't contacted me in weeks. He's one of those people who always had a new problem with his buildings, and I'd handle it. So, out of concern (and financial necessity), I decided to do a little digging to see if he'd moved out of town or maybe just found another pest control guy.</p>
		<p>What I found, however, wasn't what I expected. Mr. Moss has been listed as a missing person for the last month. The strange thing is, I spoke to him just a few weeks ago. Below is the email he sent me:</p>
	
		<p>"I've got a new apartment building that connects to some of the older subway sections that've been cut out of regular transit for some time. It's a mess under there. Could be a bigger problem with rats than usual, and we'll likely be in more frequent contact as I try to keep the tenants comfortable. But I'm sure you're used to this by now. Let's touch base soon."</p>

		<p>The email sounded... off, but I brushed it aside. Now, with him gone, I'm starting to wonder if there's more going on than just another routine infestation. The more I look into it, the stranger things seem. I'm no detective, and at my age, I'm certainly not one to go digging into matters that don't concern me. But business is business, and I need to understand what's happening to my clients. The problem is, the more I learn, the less it makes sense.</p>
		<p>There's something... big under this city. I don't mean a few rats running through the tunnels. I'm talking about something deeper, darker. And I'm too old to be chasing shadows alone.</p>
		<p>That's why I've created this site. I'm hoping that someone, somewhere, has seen or heard something similar. Maybe another pest control professional has encountered the same bizarre mutations or strange happenings. Or perhaps someone knows something about Mr.Moss's disappearance. I'm not looking to unravel this on my own- I can't. But if this site reaches the right people, maybe we can piece together the mystery before whatever's happening below the city escalates further.</p>
		<p>If you've seen anything unusual in your line of work, or if you know anything about Mr. Ross or his building, I'd appreciate hearing from you.</p>
