	<p>Welcome to the Chicago Underground Rat Investigation Society. I'm Gerald, a seasoned pest control worker on a mission to uncover the truth about a rumored giant rat living beneath the streets of Chicago.</p>
	<p>I've heard the stories for years, and while I'm getting older and a bit tired, I can't let this mystery go unsolved. I'm willing to do the work, but I need help. If you've got the curiosity and the grit to dive into the city's underground with me, we might just find the answers.</p>
	<p>Join me in solving this rodent riddle. Together, we'll get to the bottom of it.</p>

	<div class="abouttext">
	<p>James P. Moss was a landlord who made his mark in Chicago, though not always with warmth. He wasn't known for kindness, often rude and tough, but there was something dependable about him. As a contractor, I worked on many of his properties. He wasn't one for small talk or pleasantries- he handed you the job, and you did it. If you met his standards, you got paid. If not, you'd hear about it. Simple. Predictable.</p>
	<p>James wasn't easy to work with, but that consistency was rare in an industry full of chaos. You always knew where you stood with him. Maybe that's why his sudden disappearance is so strange. Some say he's missing, but honestly, I just think he's gone for good. </p>
	<p>He may not have been easy to like, but his presence was undeniable. The buildings he left behind stand as a testament to his relentless drive. Whatever happened to James- whether he's gone or just vanished- it's clear he's left his mark. We may not have been close, but we won't forget him. Not easily.</p>
